    "The Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects. It allows you to use a web browser (as opposed to a terminal or other software) to interact with a computer language interpreter (typically Python) to send commands and receive outputs. It then displays the outputs in HTML below the executed cells, and allows users to add rich text comments or annotations around code cells using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (more on this below)."

This allows us and you to sidestep the hassle of having to install software onto everyone's computers. The only thing you will need to complete all of the coding exercises in this class is a computer with a *modern web browser* and an internet connnection. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether your computer is running Linux, OSX, Windows, Chrome, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your own interests, you may be interested in installing jupyter on your own computer to try running notebooks locally. There are many tutorials online for how to do this (e.g., [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)). In this class, however, we recommend that you use our cloud-based notebooks since they will usually have data and software pre-loaded to simplify exercises. "

This cell is set up to execute a type of code called *Markdown*, which is a language for formatting text, much like HTML (which is called a *MarkUp* language). Markdown is much easier to learn than HTML, and for that reason has become a very popular tool for simple formatting and styling of text. To transform the cell back into **rendered text** you must **execute it**, which can be done by pressing the 'Run' button in the notebook toolbar while the cell is selected/highlighted, or, by **holding down the control key and pressing enter**. \n",
