Markdown is much easier to learn than HTML, and for that reason has become a very popular tool for simple formatting and styling of text. To tranform the cell back into *rendered text* you must *execute it*, which can be done by pressing the 'Run' button in the notebook tool bar, or, by **holding down the control key and pressing enter**.

You can see that the syntax to perform the same task we did above in Python is similar but a little different in bash. Learning the idiosyncracies of different coding languages takes time, and it is easiest to learn by example, which we will see a lot of throughout this course. "

You can always restart a notebook as well from the tool bar on top, which is useful if you somehow crash it. When you reach the end of a notebook you should look back over the entire document to make sure you have answered all of the required questions or actions. If you have, then save the document one last time by clicking on `Save and Checkpoint` in the File Menu (or click on the disk in the upper left). That's it. We'll review your saved notebook when it is due, and it will be graded based on your progress at that time."
