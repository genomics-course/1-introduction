    "1. Recognize that the genome can be described using text data.  \n",
    "2. Be familiar with the fasta and GFF/GTF genomic file formats.   \n",

    "### Reference genomes\n",
    "\n",
    "*What does it mean to have assembled a reference genome?* Does it mean that every DNA base-pair in the genome was sequenced once? Or that we know where every gene is located in that genome? The short answer is *No*; even the most complete genome assemblies usually have some amount of missing information. For small genomes, like viruses, we can easily sequence every base, however, there remains variation among individuals and populations that is not represented in a single *reference genome*. For larger genomes, like humans, some parts of the genome are difficult to assemble because they are highly repetitive, and these are often missing or error-prone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many genome assemblies are published only in *draft* form, meaning that they are still a work in progress. The best genomes are assembled into complete chromosomes, whereas many others are still represented as thousands of assembled fragments which we don't yet know how to piece together correctly. The evolution of new technologies for improving genome assemblies will be a major topic of this class. But for now, let's start by looking at a few small complete genomes. "

That's right, genomic data can be represented as simple text, using the letters <span style=\"color:red;\">A</span>, <span style=\"color:green;\">C</span>, <span style=\"color:blue;\">G</span>, and <span style=\"color:darkorange;\">T</span> to refer to the nucleotides (molecules) that make up DNA. Pretty convenient, huh? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because genomic data files are typically large, analyzing or even just looking at genomic data  requires learning to use efficient software tools for working with large text files. It may surprise you to learn that many of the best tools for this are actually the basic command line tools developed for unix based computers. Computer file systems are also written in text, and so many of the most common and basic programming tools are designed specifically to be able to very efficiently read, edit, or analyze text. "

In science we refer to this as *reproducibility* -- creating documents that others can use to reproduce our work entirely. In this course, we will use notebooks to share code with you for completing assignments; you can run the code, learn from it, and even edit the code or text. Upon completing each notebook, you will have entered in new values and produced new results, which you can then save, download and submit as your completed assignment for us to grade.

    "\n",
    "[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is a language for interacting with a **terminal** (it is a command line language). We will primarily use bash to run *executable computer programs* in a terminal. Those program themselves may be written in a variety of computer languages, often C, fortran, or even Python. There are several languages similar to bash for running commands in a terminal, of which bash is the most commonly used. "

However, for the purpose of your assignments we will have you instead execute bash code inside of jupyter notebooks. Again, this is for the sake of reproducibility, notebooks keep a record of the code that you execute, so it is easy to share, and for our purposes, to hand in as an assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To say that we are going to \"run a command line program using bash inside of a jupyter notebook\" is describing a [multi-layered](https://tenor.com/view/shrek-onions-gif-5703242) process: jupyter actually uses Python to connect to a temporary bash terminal, which then runs the command line program, captures the output, and returns it to jupyter, which displays the output in your notebook. This sounds complicated, but it's all happening behind the scenes. To run bash code in the notebook all you have to do is append  `%%bash` to the top of a code cell. "

You can see that all of our files have the ending `.fna.gz`, meaning that they are in fasta format, but they are also *gzip compressed* (.gz). Compression is used to store large files more efficiently. When files are compressed we sometimes need to use additional tools to decompress them before reading the contents. Many genomic software tools are designed to work with compressed files so that we can just enter the compressed file into the program directly. Here we will leave the files compressed to save disk space (e.g. the compressed Chicken genome is about 0.3 Gb) and simply decompress their contents on the fly as we read/stream it.    "

The second trick here is that we are using a `pipe`. As you learned in your linux tutorial, pipes are used to send the output of one program directly into the input of another. Here we pipe the streamed output of `zcat` directly into the program `head`. This way we do not read the entire file into memory at once, which would be too much text for a jupyter notebook to display comfortably, and instead capture only the first N lines to print to stdout. As you can see, now that we are using the `zcat` command to decompress the stream of text it looks like sensible DNA data. "

    "Another great tool that can perform similar tasks to this is called [awk](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-awk1/index.html). The basic format of an `awk` command is in the form of a string argument stating `\"x == y {do z}\"`. It is similar to cut in that it is designed to work on delimited fields of text. Below we print the attributes field (`$9`) if the type field (`$3`) matches 'gene'. Using awk we can accomplish similar tasks to what we did above using grep and cut. \n",

    "NB: Awk is a complex tool that can take a long time to master. We do not expect you to master it today. Just try it out. By learning that it exists and what it can do you can more easily google later to find an awk command that will accomplish the task you are attempting. But don't get too worried if you find this last section difficult. \n"
